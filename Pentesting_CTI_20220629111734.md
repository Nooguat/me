# Note from Let's defend lessons 
Intelligence is one of the most importants things -> can build defense before attacks

CTI : *Collects data from many sources to determine the motivation; targets and TTPs of the cyber actors*

## CTI Lifecycle :
1. Planning : Purpose and objectives of the CTI 
2. Collection : Collecting data from many sources
3. Processing : Making the data ready for analysis
4. Analysis : Transform the data to usable and shareable intelligence
5. Dissemination : Sharing the intelligence 
6. Feedback : Determine if arrangements should be made for future CTI 

## Types of CTI : 
1. Tactical : Get informations about the tactics; techniques and procedures of the thread actor (aka TTP)

Usually used by SIEM; SOC analyst and Security product makers (Firewalls; IPS; EDR...)

2. Operational : Get informations about the motivation actors

Used by : Threat Hunters; Sec. ingineers

3. Strategic : Analysis of trends and emerging risks to create an overall picture of the possible consequences of cyber attack
