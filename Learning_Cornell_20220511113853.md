# Cornell Method

Note taking method created by Walter Pauk. Recommanded for lessons notes for its flexibility and usefulness. 
Its consists in 4 boxes : header, 2 columns (1/3 ration for the right part) and a footer
header is the identifying part (course name, date), the right column is the notes you take and the left one the recall column (keywords, questions...)
The footer is used after the class to sum up the main ideas with your own words.
