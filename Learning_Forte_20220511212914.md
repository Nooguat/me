# Week review

This is from Tiago Forte list 
First, mails treatement must be automatized, using the Inbox Zero protocol
Then the decluttering goes this way : 
Calender (review recent meet and dates)
Downloads/Desktop (delete or integrate)
Notes (review and create tasks)
Tasks (group all the tasks from the previous steps and prioritize)
