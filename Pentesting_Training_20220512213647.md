# Plateforms for pentesting training

HTB is very good but limited in free path, certifications could be intrusting

Pentester lab is very complete in web, offers a certification

Portswigger lab is very good to understand how web testing works

Github is a not so known plateform, but using the "ctf" and "hacking practise"

Ctftime for still online challenges to try, with the write-up already written
