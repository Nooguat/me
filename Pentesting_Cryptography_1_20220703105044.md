# Cryptography

## Differences between Crypt{ography, ology, analysis}

Root : Crypto -> secret in ancien greek

- Cryptography : System that allow secure communications
- Cryptanalysis : Analyse of the Cryptographic systems
- Cryptology : Study of system of secure communications 

Cryptography falls under the CIA laws of information security -> although the availibility is out of the reach of cryptography

Can add the Non-repudiation and Authenticity goals (Any third-party can verify the information; the source of information can be verified by a recieving party)

## How to create confidential systems in analog world

1. Symmetric encryption -> safes 
  Authorization means having the key of the save or being the author of the plaintext
  Does not scale well with the participants number : quadratic evolution
2. Asymmetric encryption -> mailboxes 
  Authorization means having the mailbox key or being the author of the plaintext
  Does scale well with the number of participants : linear evolution. However, does not work with big messages (e.g. packages)
3. Hybrid encryption -> mixing safes and mailboxes
  Putting the safe code inside the mailbox and changing the safe after usage

## Symmetric encryption 
  - One key for both encrypt and decrypt
  - Used by the **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** : block cipher -> encrypt plaintext 128 bits chunks
    - Chunks are called blocks -> differents types : ECB, CBC, GCM
    - Created in 2001 by the NIST
  - Security of the keys : for a key of n bits ; 2^n combinaisons possibles. Accepts keys of 128, 192 and 256 bits; so secure against brute force
  - The issue stays in the number of required keys ; for 10k people; you need almost 50 millions keys -> does not bring confidentiality
### ECB concept
  *(Electronic Code Book)* 

  Very simple and very fast; each 128 bit chunk is encrypted and decrypted isolated 

  So simple that insecure -> give the size of the file 
### CBC concept
  *(Cipher Block Chaining)*

  The most implemented variation 
  
  The encryption is chained -> the encryption of a block relies on the other ones

  -> The first block is XORed with random bits (the key) and then the second block is XORed with the key from the first block to generate a new key

  Secure if done properly; but slower than the ECB
